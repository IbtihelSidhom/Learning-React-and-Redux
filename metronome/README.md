# :pushpin: Metronome

Just a Metronome!

## Key points I learnt with this app:
One of the main things I've learned is the usefullnes of arrow functions. Since "this" will be automatically bound to refer to the Metronome instance, and everything will work Fine. Whereas for a regular function the "this" binding would be lost when it gets passed to the onChange handler in render.
