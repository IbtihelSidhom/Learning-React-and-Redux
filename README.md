# Some apps to get familiar with React and Redux

## :pushpin: Skypey

This free book :blue_book: by Emmanuel Ohans: [The Worldâ€™s Easiest Guide to Beginning Redux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-redux-the-worlds-easiest-guide-to-beginning-redux-c695f45546f6/) helped me a lot to begin learning Redux. I just followed his instructions throughout the book as he explains redux-related concepts and applied them to the example app.




## Getting started

To get these apps running locally:

- Clone this repo
- point to the folder of the app you want to run
- `npm install` to install all required dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (all apps use create-react-app)
